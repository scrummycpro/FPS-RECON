# Fast People Search Scraper

## Overview
This Bash script allows you to scrape information from the Fast People Search website (https://www.fastpeoplesearch.com/) for a given phone number. It extracts various details such as full name, age, address, phone numbers, and relatives associated with the provided phone number. The extracted information is then stored in a SQLite database for further analysis or processing.

## Requirements
- Bash shell
- w3m text-based web browser
- SQLite3

## Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Bash, w3m, and SQLite3 installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
3. Make the script executable using the command `chmod +x fps_scraper.sh`.
4. Run the script with a phone number as an argument. For example:
   ```
   ./fps_scraper.sh 702-439-6350
   ```
5. The script will scrape the Fast People Search website for the provided phone number, extract relevant information, and store it in a SQLite database named `people_data.db`.

## Script Details
- The script begins by creating a SQLite database file (`people_data.db`) and a table (`people`) to store the extracted information if they don't already exist.
- It then uses the `w3m` text-based web browser to retrieve the webpage content for the provided phone number from the Fast People Search website.
- Next, it extracts the following information from the webpage content:
  - Full Name
  - Age
  - Current Home Address
  - Past Addresses
  - Phone Numbers
  - Relatives
- The extracted information is cleaned and formatted using `grep` and `sed` commands.
- Finally, the cleaned data is inserted into the SQLite database for further use.

## Database Schema
The SQLite database (`people_data.db`) consists of a single table named `people` with the following schema:

| Column Name    | Data Type | Description                                       |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| id             | INTEGER   | Primary key auto-incremental ID                  |
| full_name      | TEXT      | Full name of the person                          |
| age            | TEXT      | Age of the person (if available)                 |
| current_address| TEXT      | Current home address of the person               |
| past_addresses | TEXT      | Past addresses associated with the person         |
| phone_numbers  | TEXT      | Phone numbers associated with the person          |
| relatives      | TEXT      | Relatives of the person                           |

## Notes
- The script relies on the structure and layout of the Fast People Search website. Any changes to the website's layout or HTML structure may break the scraping process.
- It's recommended to use this script responsibly and in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
